##Installation

### ESX v1.1/1.2

Don't change the name of the resource or you'll have issues with the NUI!

Copy the sql file to your database and copy the mdt folder to your server resources.


### ESX v.1.2Final

If you're using the final version then you'll need to [download the attachments in this forum post](https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-hypaste-rps-mobile-data-terminal-reports-warrants-calls-searches-more/1701472/77) or you'll have issues with trying to create reports and calls. As mentioned above, do not set the name of this resource to anything except mdt unless you know what you're doing.
